I have added some styling to the CSS to show what is happening when the figure is displayed. If you 'inspect' the elements when the webpage is displayed (Firefox: menu Tools... WebDeveloper... Inspector) you will see that the figure element has a default left and right margin of 40 pixels, whereas as a paragraph element has a default left and right margin of 0. So why is there a gap on the left hand side of the paragraph? The body element has a default left and right margin of 8 pixels. You can change this by adding the rule body { margin: 0; } to the CSS file which will set all the body element margins to 0. ]
