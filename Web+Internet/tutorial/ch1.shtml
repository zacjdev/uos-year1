    <h1>Chapter 1. Introduction</h1>

    <p>There are many ways to create web pages, including writing HTML and CSS using a text editor, using tools such as
      <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, using content management
      systems (e.g. <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a
        href="https://www.joomla.org">Joomla!</a>) or maintaining a code base on a web server and using PHP and/or other
      languages to dynamically produce web pages. In this module, we will focus on directly writing HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript, without any accompanying libraries. I believe that this will give you the foundations to build on in the future. In addition, there are
      advantages to understanding all three of these languages. For more discussion of why it is important to learn
      HTML, see <a href="https://www.petelambert.com/journal/html-is-the-web/">HTML is the Web</a>.</p>

    <p>The early chapters of this website focus on HTML and CSS, and using these in mobile-first responsive web design, which is what is advocated on this module &ndash; we'll discuss this in lectures, but you might like to take a look at the websites of <a
      href="https://ethanmarcotte.com">Ethan Marcotte</a> and <a href="https://www.lukew.com">Luke
      Wroblewski</a>. Whilst this material is covered in lectures, I have
      also included some explanation of the main ideas mixed in with the exercises. This will help remind you of relevant
      ideas before undertaking the exercises.</p>

    <p>Suggested solutions are given for each exercise. However, for many of the exercises there is no single correct
      solution, so please bear in mind that your solution for a particular exercise may be just as good as the suggested one, even if it is different. </p>

    <p>Throughout the early chapters, I make use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn"
        target="_blank">excellent resources supplied by Mozilla</a>, providing links to their relevant pages on HTML and CSS.
      I suggest you make their website your first port of call if you are looking up a feature on HTML or CSS. Whilst you
      could use a general Internet search to find out about particular features, you should be wary of out-of-date
      information. It is important that when you search for information, you 'weigh' the reliability of the information.
      I believe the Mozilla site provides reliable information.</p>

    <p>The latter chapters of this website focus on JavaScript. For the individual chapters, I have focussed only on
      presenting the exercises and their solutions, rather than giving any introduction to specific JavaScript. The
      module lectures will do this. Also, you need to practise searching for relevant information yourself. However, to get you started, I have given links to specific pages on Mozilla's website and also other websites, as appropriate.</p>

    <p>Some of you may have met HTML and/or CSS and/or JavaScript before. Nonetheless, I encourage you to read through
      the relevant sections so that you are aware of techniques I expect to see in your assignment work.</p>

    <h3>Example code</h3>

    <p>Appendix C includes a zip file to download all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for each chapter. These are
      organised into a series of folders, one per chapter. (Appendix A presents a short overview of files and folders if
      these terms are unfamiliar to you.)</p>

    <h3>Development</h3>

    <p>I do not advocate a specific editor to develop your code. I have used <a
        href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio
        Code</a> when developing both the website and the exercise solutions. Some of you may prefer something more
      complex such as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). For the size of example we are looking at, I have found Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code to be more than adequate. You should install one or both of these on your computer.</p>

      <h3>Typos and errors</h3>

      <p>If you spot any <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/208379?rskey=C212c5&result=1&isAdvanced=false#eid">typo</a>s or errors, please do let me know using the link in the footer below.</p>
